# Technical Communication

**Introduction**
* The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. 
* These layers work together to enable the seamless communication of data between different systems and devices. 
* Here are the seven OSI layers, from the lowest to the highest.

**1. Physical Layer:** 
* This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over a physical medium, such as cables and connectors. 
* It specifies the hardware and electrical characteristics of the transmission medium.

**2. Data Link Layer:**
* This layer manages data framing, error detection, and flow control. 
* It ensures the reliable transmission of data over a physical link.

**3. Network Layer:**
* The network layer is responsible for addressing, routing, and forwarding data packets between different networks. 
* It provides logical addressing and routing capabilities.

**4. Transport Layer:** 
* This layer ensures end-to-end communication, error detection, and correction. 
* It manages data flow and may establish, maintain, and terminate connections.

**5. Session Layer:** 
* The session layer manages and controls the dialog between two devices, establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions or connections.

**6. Presentation Layer:** 
* The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression. 
* It prepares data for the application layer.

**7. Application Layer:**
* The application layer is the topmost layer and is responsible for providing services to end-user applications. 
* It interacts directly with user software and handles application-specific functions. 
* It includes application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and others.
